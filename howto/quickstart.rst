==============================
Quickstart and common examples
==============================

If you're reading this it's presumed that you're already familiar with the structure and usage of CellML models, and you want to get started on creating or reading your own as soon as possible.
If that doesn't sound like you, and you'd rather start with a gentler introduction, please start from :ref:`Tutorial 0<tutorial0>` instead.

This section is divided into chapters based on tasks that we anticipate the most common user groups would need, and gives examples of the processes that each might follow.
