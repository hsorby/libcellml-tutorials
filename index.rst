libCellML Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation for libCellML, including user tutorials, developer guidelines, installation information and the formal language specification.

The purpose of libCellML is to create, manipulate, serialise, deserialise, validate and instantiate :cellml2:`CellML2 <>` models.
All serialising and deserialising is to and from standard strings and using the CellML2.0 specification.
The library is intended to be lightweight and focused purely in dealing with :cellml2:`CellML <>` models.
