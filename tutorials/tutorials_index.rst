COMBINE2020 libCellML Tutorials
===============================

Please follow the :ref:`Installation instructions<installation_index>` first to get yourself a copy of libCellML.

The first set of tutorials below take the user progressively through different aspects of the libCellML functionality while building towards a model of Hodgkin and Huxley's squid axon activation.

The second set is agnostic as to application, and works only to illustrate the functionality.
It is a simpler starting point for users who are unfamiliar with CellML and/or modelling in general.
