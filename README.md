# libcellml-tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for users of the libCellML library, available in both in C++ and Python.  

The purpose of libCellML is to create, manipulate, serialise, deserialise, validate and instantiate CellML models.
See more information on CellML at https://www.cellml.org/.

The library is intended to be lightweight and focused solely on dealing with CellML models. 

For tutorials and documentation for contributors to the development of libCellML, please see http://libcellml.readthedocs.io/ instead.
